Description: Facilitates robust sampling of the Twitter graph by saving
  data about observed nodes into a data cache. Requests for new nodes are
  smart and do not waste API requests on nodes already in the cache. The
  cache can then be exported to a number of data structures more
  appropriate for network analysis. Automatically manages multiple tokens
  to speed up sampling with staying with API rate limits.
