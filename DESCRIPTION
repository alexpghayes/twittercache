Description: Facilitates robust sampling of the Twitter graph by
    saving data about observed nodes into a data cache. Requests for new
    nodes are smart and do not waste API requests on nodes already in the
    cache. The cache can then be exported to a number of data structures
    more appropriate for network analysis. Automatically manages multiple
    tokens to speed up sampling with staying with API rate limits.
