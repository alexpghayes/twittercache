\title{Robustly sample the twitter graph}
\usage{
sample_twitter_graph()
}
\description{
Once you have added users to the request queue, run
\code{sample_twitter_graph()}. That's it. Data about each
user is saved into the cache as soon it is received.
\strong{Do not use your tokens to make API calls} outside
of \code{twittergraph} while running this function.
}
\details{
If your R session crashes, you lose internet
connection, whatever, it doesn't matter. Just run
\code{sample_twitter_graph()} again and the sampling will pick
up right where it left off.

Sampling will automatically use all registered tokens,
and will respect rates limits, providing \code{twittergraph}
is the only application making API calls. Currently
we use a simple heuristic to respect rate limits:
request information about a single users per token
per minute.
