\title{Visit a node in the twitter graph and add it to the cache}
\usage{
visit(node, token)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{The user id of a Twitter user. \emph{Not} the screen name.}
}
\description{
The logic here is fundamentally oriented around visiting
a single user at a time, and adding them to the cache as
soon as we have their data.
}
\details{
Note that since the logic here is fundamentally about
sampling every user, if we visit an entire neighborhood
we'll pick up most edges twitter, once from each accompanying
node.

We only take the first 5,000 friends and 5,000 followers
for the time being. The idea is that for important edges,
the edge will get picked up from the other node. This may
miss out on edges between node both with huge follower
and following counts, but who cares about those.
