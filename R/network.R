#' Export the edge data from the cache to an edge list

#' quickly. I recommend saving the results to an `.rds`
#' file for convenience. I also recommend subsetting
#' as much as possible to the part of the graph you
#' are interested in. `get_edge_data()` is typically
#' much slower than [get_node_data()].
#'
#' If you only need the graph and don't need any data

#'   type [bit64::integer64()]. This breaks from the `rtweet`
#'   tradition of storing user IDs as character vectors,
#'   because character encoding user IDs quickly becomes
#'   inefficient for even moderate sized caches, which can
#'   contain millions of edges.
#'
#'   To my knowledge, you should be able to use these columns
#'   just like you'd expect. If you are uncomfortable with
#'   [bit64::integer64()] columns, you can convert them to
#'   character columns with `as.character()`. **Do not**
#'   convert the columns to a base integer or numeric vector
#'   with `as.integer` or `as.numeric`: this will result in
#'   data loss.

#'   when we recorded data for a particular user. The rest of
#'   the columns are the output of [rtweet::lookup_users()],
#'   while I will not document in detail here. This is a
#'   mixture of information about the user profile, and
#'   also their most recent tweet (at the time of sampling).
#'
#'   **There is one key difference from `rtweet::lookup_users()`**
#'   output, which is the `user_id` column is a [bit64::integer64()]
#'   vector rather than a character vector. This is to facilitate
#'   easy joining with the edgelist produced by [get_edge_data()].
#'   It is okay to convert this column to a character vector if
#'   you would like, but **do not** convert the `user_id` column
#'   to a base integer or numeric vector with `as.integer` or
#'   `as.numeric`: this will result in data loss.
#'
#'   Another particularly useful column is the `screen_name`
#'   column, which contains the user handles that you use to
#'   interact with other users on Twitter.
#'
#' @details If you `request()`ed user A, and user A follows user B,
#'   but you did not request user B, user A will appear in the node
#'   data but user B will not. We call user A a *core* user here,
#'   and user B a *peripheral*. `twittercache` does not allow
#'   you to request information about protected users, but it is
#'   still possible that some peripheral users will be protected
#'   accounts.
